                                                       #Overview of Project
                                                         
This analysis is real-life campaign data from different Kickstarter projects around the world. The raw data has many categories; some essential types are pledge funding, goal funding, country, outcomes, and other categories. This project takes these categories and approximately 4100 data points to clean and analyze to help Louise with her Kickstarter campaign.

                                                            #Analysis
Louise wanted to research to ensure her play “Fever” became a successful campaign from start to finish; by doing so, the following tools were used to analyze the data.

Conditional formatting: Customizing the cell appearance to make it look cleaner and ease to the eyes of viewers by color coding, various fonts, and text sizes to the cells.

Functions: Essential math functions have been used to understand the data further, using average, percentage, iferror, time stamps, standard deviation, and CountIfs functions. When a variable is divided by 0, it causes an error (#div/0!), which the Iferror condition helped us resolve. 
Splitting Column: Breaking the content of cells into multiple cells. We used the method to break parent category and subcategory into two different columns, which helped to conduct the research more precisely.  

Pivot Table and chart: Pivot Chart helped to take desired data points of specific groups and build a table, and the charting mechanism helped visualize the data. The pivot chart has four fields filters, rows, columns, and values. We must plug in all the fields to get a chart and its deals. Excel is so powerful that from the chart we create, it can insert a graph that corresponds with the chart.

                                                      #Challenges and Difficulties
The challenge is starting the analysis by asking questions, building a roadmap, and figuring out what the requestor of the project is seeking from the study. How to make the data neat and what tools to use to analyze the data can be overwhelming. But a well-defined written roadmap helped me break down the problems and overcome them. 
  
                                                                #Results
Theater outcomes Based on Launch Date: From the chart, we can see that the highest number of plays were produced during May. This concludes that summertime is the more play produced than the rest of the year. The graph depicts that the time May-June has the highest number of successful theater outcomes.

During the winter and holiday season (Nov-Jan), the total number of theater plays is lower; also, failed rate comparatively is high. Which concludes winter season is not an ideal time to introduce a play.

Outcomes-Based on Goals: The graph shows that when the goal amount gets more significant, it lowers the success rate. We see that when the funding goal is less than $1000 to up to $4999, a project has over a 70% chance of being successful.

As the funding goal becomes larger $45000-$49999 success rate is zero, the failure rate is 100%, and the $50000 or more failed rate is over 80%, so the success rate is less than 20%.

                                                                 #Summary
                                                                    
In the project, we mainly focused on United States data. I recommend analyzing different countries' data to see which country is prosperous and why. For example, the chart below shows other counties' theaters' success and failure rates. Although the US produced more total theater projects than any country, GB has more successful theater outcomes.

There is no mention of demographic on the Kickstarter. For example which gender is funding for the theater programs. Also, knowing the ages of the people will be helpful as to target the specific group to reach the goal of funding. 

Lastly, what type of campaign has been used for advertising the plays. Where they advised such as in the social media, newspapers, flyers, etc., knowing that would have been very helpful to understand how to get better funding and the right way to conduct a successful play.
